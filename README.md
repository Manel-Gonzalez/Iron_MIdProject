# Mid Term Project - Ironhack vue.js Bootcamp
This project generates a responsive web (the visual design with the specs was provided by Ironhack) , with HTML5, CSS, .js, and a json-server to simulate a database (post and consume). 
The project is deployed at https://epic-mirzakhani-2222ac.netlify.app/index.html (if you don't run the json server as detailed in the how to section, some parts relying on it won't be displayed)

# How to run
One easy way to test and visualize the project is by following these steps: 
1. Set your directory to the main project folder.
2. Run `json-server --watch db.json`.
3. Open https://epic-mirzakhani-2222ac.netlify.app/index.html.
